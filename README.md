# Power-BI-Project
A personal Power BI Project, created as a porfolio project. It concerns economic freedom around the world and its implications.

## Version 1.0

### Introduction

This project is part of my professional portfolio, intended to list my current Power BI skills. This repository lists all the addition & modifications made to this projet.
The main intention of this project is to explain the concept of economic freedom and to demonstrate how this concept can help countries to prosperate.
This project consists of:
- Two datasets (one for economic freedom data, one for GDP per capita data), taken from Excel files
- A PBIX file, with the report itself
- A PDF file with a report

### Description

This Power BI report lists:

- Almost all countries around the world and their economic freedom score, as listed in the [Heritage Foundation webpage](https://www.heritage.org/index/)
- Shows specific categories for each country concerning their economic freedom, such as:
  - Property Rights: how much property are respected in the country
  - Goverment Integrity: how corrupt the country's government is
  - Judicial Effectiveness: how independent, fair and efficient the judicial system of a country is
  - Tax Burden: the amount of taxes that individuals & companies pay in a country, as wel as the tax burden as a percentage of the GDP
  - Government Spending: how much that the country's government spends (the more it spends, the worst is the score)
  - Fiscal Health: how responsible the country's government is with its budget (it measures average deficits & debt, as a percentage of the GDP)
  - Business Freedom: the amount of rules & regulations that companies need to comply in order to operate in a country (the more rules it has, the worst is the score)
  - Labor Freedom: the country's amount of regulations concerning the labor force (the more labor rights it has, the worst the score is)
  - Monetary Freedom: how stables prices are in a country, considering its inflation rate and government intervention through subsidies & price controls
  - Trade Freedom: measures the extend of tarrif and ontarrif barriers in a country
  - Investment Freedom: the amount of regulations imposed on investment
  - Financial Freedom: how government intereferes with the financial and banking sector (the more it interferes, the worst is the score)
- In addition to that, it displays a treemap showing the GDP Per Capita per country. The source of the GDP Per Capita data is at the [World Bank website](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD?end=2024&start=1990)
- And finally, a graph showing the correlation between economic freedom & GDP Per Capita

## Plans for the future
- Add more visualization for this report, such as evolution of both economic freedom and GDP Per Capita through the years since 1995
- Create visualizations using Python langugage, for more customizible options
